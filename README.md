# Virtual Faculty Writing Retreats as Commitment Devices Increase Grant Submissions 
# ABSTRACT: Grants are essential to academic science, yet behavioral hurdles hinder optimal grant-writing engagement. We designed and evaluated a virtual faculty writing retreat—a 5-day intervention, with daily 3-hour Zoom sessions—to enhance academic scientists’ grant-writing productivity. In a randomized trial across over 20 U.S. medical schools and 294 faculty members, the treatment group doubled grant submission rates compared to that of the control group, averaging 0.6 additional submissions—a 63% increase in the share who submitted any grant. The program reallocated ~5 hours from research to grant-writing without compromising proposal quality, with faculty with weaker baseline research track records (i.e., awarded grants, publications) benefiting most, suggesting the program’s impact on reducing innovation disparities. This study provides the first causal evidence linking academic writing retreats to scholarly output. As virtual scientific work expands, this scalable solution could enhance productivity and equity in science.
